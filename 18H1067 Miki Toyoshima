I'm Miki Toyoshima.
 I'm interested in English Literature. 
I'm currently reading Murder in Mesopotamia written by Agatha Christie.
 This book is one of the series of Hercule Poirot works. 
Before Poirot appear in the story,I was frustrated because this part is pretty redundancy. 
But after Poirot appear,description become so vivid. It's really enjoyable to read. 
I want to read many other English Literature Works.
